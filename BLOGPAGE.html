			<h4><i> a painting ? </i><br><br>
				 <i>a sketch ?   </i><br><br>
				 <i>a wall mural maybe ? </i></h4><br>
			<h3>But that's not what art is all about.</h3>
		</div>
		
		<div class="two-col">
		<p>In my opinion, ART is a generalized term for <i>anything</i> that <i>you love</i> doing.<br><br>
			something that makes you feel good on your bad days,<br>
			something that you're not forced to do by someone, <br>
			something that you discover yourself while growing up, <br>
			something that keeps calling you when you're bored, <br>
			something that you call your form of therapy, <br>
			<i>something that comes from within.</i>
		</p>
		<h3 style="line-height:40px">THAT'S ART.</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 18px"><b>For me that <i>something</i> is sketching and painting.</b></p>

		<div class="heading">HAVING A HOBBY - AN ART WITHIN</div><br>
		<p>Everyone has some form of ART present within them, maybe they develop it over the years, or it's just there.<br><br>
				someone may love penning down their thoughts and turn it into<i> poetry,</i><br>
				someone may love to hold a brush and turn the canvas into a beautiful landscape, <br>
				someone may love to dance like no one's watching, <br>
				someone may love to fix the broken pieces together- I'm talking about jigsaw puzzles xD <br>
				someone may love to capture every little detail around them, <br>
				someone may love quizzing, singing, cooking, and whatnot. <br>
		</p>
		<p>These are the forms of <i>art</i> that we know, <i>the list never ends though.</i><br>
			What's important is, having a hobby. <br>
			Having something <i><b><pre> for yourself</pre></b></i> that no one can ever take away from you.

		<div class="heading">ART v/s SKILL</div><br>
		<p>Any artist needs to have a throbbing heart, an opinion, courage to express it and imagination to choose his/her own form of expression.
			With all these whatever he/she creates becomes art, not otherwise.
			His/her way of expression becomes style.
			Some revelations lead to revolutions, either in the form of expression or in real life. 
			Some revelations lead to realization. <br><br>

			Art takes much more than just skill. <br>
			Patience and enjoyment are the two key factors that can do wonders, 
			even if you don't have the required skill.

		<div class="heading">ART AS THERAPY</div><br>
		<p>Art therapy is a therapeutic approach that promotes healing by tapping into and revealing an individual's deepest thoughts and feelings through art. <br>
			Often, we feel therapy is given to someone having any disorder or undergoing depression. <br>
			But, the underlying truth is that we all need <i>therapy</i> and the best part is we can choose our form of therapy. <br>
		</p>
		<p>Art should be treated as therapy because it helps us <br>
			to give time to ourselves, <br>
			to calm down our racing thoughts, <br>
			to express our feelings and emotions, <br>
			to discover ourselves, and <br>
			<i>to feel better.</i>
